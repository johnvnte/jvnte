### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm John - Data Scientist at STATWORX. This is my personal repository containing some small side project of mine. My passion lies in building applications for non-tech users, that allows them to get insights into their data.

While having a R background my personal projects focus more on Python. I'm especially curious about unleashing the full capabilities of R and Python using container technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes and web-frameworks such as FastAPI. I also gathered some front-end development experience by using RShiny and Python Streamlit.
